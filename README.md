# Search Extensions

This package contains a bunch of tools, examples, samples and queries to be used with Unity Search.

The Search Extensions package will work with Unity 2020.3 and any other versions higher than 2021.2.
- If you are using 20.3: also install the `com.unity.quicksearch@3.0.0-preview.22` package.
- If you are using 21.2+ : Search extensions will use the built-in Search framework.

## Package Installation

There are 2 ways to install the package. Either download the code and embed it in your project or use the Package Manager *Install from git url* feature.

### If you are on 20.3

You first need to install the latest preview version of the QuickSearch package. 

1) Go to menu Edit->Project Settings. Select Package Manager and enable *Preview Package*.
